	<h2>Digital Visitor Guide</h2>

		Harnessing MoMA’s collection data to improve wayfinding for visitors
	</p>

<div class="body-content">
<h4>Background</h4>
<h3>Visitors are overwhelmed by MoMA’s scale, and aren’t sure where to start.</h3>
<p>Upon reopening in 2020, MoMA’s digital product team released an MVP digital visitor guide (or DVG), meant to replace onsite resources like paper maps, rentable audio devices, and volunteer guides. Over one million visitors use the DVG each year, and wayfinding is reported as our visitors’ biggest challenge.</p>
<p><img src="/img/moma-dvg/dvg-before.png" alt="Three screenshots of the digital visitor guide in 2023, including the homepage, open map accordion, and PDF map"></p>
<p class="caption">The digital visitor guide in 2023</p>
<p>The original DVG map was a link to a PDF. Unsurprisingly, our users found this difficult to read and navigate on their phones. The graphic design team also found it tedious to update, and visitor engagement still had to field hundreds of questions a day. We had the data users were looking for, like artwork locations and whether an exhibition is on view, but it wasn’t centralized for the onsite visitor.</p>
<p>Our team decided to create an interactive, data-rich map of the museum, accessible from our website. The map integrates with our collection and exhibition data, making it easy for visitors to find their favorite artworks and discover new ones (and eliminated an extra resource for our colleagues to update).</p>
<h4>Project outcomes</h4>
<p>Our interactive map with a complete guide to the galleries increased the average DVG user session duration from 12 to 28 seconds (2.3x). Our lobby staff has reported that the map integration with the rest of the site has empowered users to find artworks themselves, rather than asking staff. Visitors are also engaging more with the rest of moma.org. We saw significantly increased traffic to our Artwork, Exhibition, and Collection gallery pages—the map's  them to online resources to further enrich their visit.</p>
<h4>My role</h4>
<p>I collaborated with another designer on research and initial wireframing, and I led high fidelity design. Along with our UX research fellow, we ran in-person usability testing, and I worked closely with our developer to perform visual QA and perfect the interactions.</p>
</div>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<h3>Creating a map to serve all of our visitor’s needs</h3>
<p>MoMA’s visitors typically fall into two groups—those visiting for the first time, and New Yorkers or members who have visited before. First-timers are typically tourists who want to see the whole museum, and consider MoMA to be a landmark. Repeat visitors are often drawn to visit by a specific exhibition or artwork.</p>
<p>An image-forward directory with a more modern map would be essential in serving both of these groups.</p>
<h3>Surfacing our existing data to our users, and reducing burden on staff</h3>
<p>moma.org runs on our internal CMS and the collection database TMS, meaning internal teams only need to update one entry in order to populate an exhibition page, homepage, and onsite screens. Why couldn’t the visitor guide also run on this data? This ensures that locations, exhibition dates, and on-view status for artworks and exhibitions are always up to date.</p>
<h3>Meeting users where they are through our site search and artwork pages</h3>
<p>A common pattern is for users to search for artworks and artists using our global site search. Previously, on view artworks were not prioritized in listings, and gallery locations were not linked to the map.</p>
<p>On artist pages, we pushed artworks that were on view to the top of the list, and on artworks pages, we linked out to the gallery where the artwork was located. This made it much easier for visitors to use our site to find specific artworks and artist they wanted to see.</p>
