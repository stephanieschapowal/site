		Streamlining the ticket-buying process for both visitors and staff

<h4>Background</h4>
<h3>MoMA’s online ticketing system was optimized for timed entry slots, not a seamless purchase experience</h3>
<p>During the pandemic, MoMA adopted a timed ticketing system for admission to prevent lines and ease crowding. To stand up this solution quickly during uncertain times, the Digital Product team had turned to ACME’s (our ticket management vendor) white label solution. While the white label did a great job of handling time slots, its six screen flow took an average of 7 minutes to complete, was saddled with confusing out-of-the-box copy, and was unable to support membership or Design Store upsells. With timed ticketing no longer necessary, our team took the opportunity to use ACME’s API to build an in-house ticketing solution.</p>
<p><img src="/img/moma-ticketing/ticketing-before.png" alt="Overview of MoMA's old ticketing flow"></p>
<p class="caption">The old ticketing flow had six steps, and required visitors to sift through a lot of information to figure out which ticket types they were eligible for.</p>
<h4>My role</h4>
<p>As part of this process, I gathered requirements from stakeholders across the museum (including those in marketing, membership, visitor engagement, and IT), developed user personas for our visitors, created high fidelity designs, and performed usability testing and A/B tests.</p>
<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<p>By focusing on an intuitive and accessible user experience, we saw revenue from online ticketing increase 4.5% in the first six months after launch. For our users, the average time to checkout was reduced by over 50%. The new design also provided a foundation for future experimentation and testing by our growth squad, leading to a successful membership upsell offer system, and the addition of digital wallet payments.</p>
<p>We were able to make critical improvements for staff, like growing marketing’s email subscription list, and easing requests of our lobby staff by optimizing our confirmation page and digital tickets to prepare visitors for their day at MoMA.</p>
<h4>Approach</h4>
<h3>Trimming the checkout flow from six screens to three</h3>
<p>One of our highest priorities was to radically shorten the amount of steps it took to buy a ticket. We wanted to optimize the experience for visitors buying tickets on their phones—often on the go during their trip to NYC. We decided on a three step checkout flow: select your tickets, enter your information, and a confirmation screen.</p>
<p><img src="/img/moma-ticketing/ticketing-steps.png" alt="Three step checkout flow"></p>
<p class="caption">We reduced the new flow to encompass only three screens: selecting your date and tickets, entering your information, and a confirmation screen.</p>
<h3>Directing users to the right tickets for them</h3>
<p>As the first step, our old flow asked users to identify themselves as a member, non-member, student, or affiliate. Users found some of the options unclear (“not a member” felt a bit negative), and the distinct pages led users to believe they were missing out on options available to them. I laid out the ticket types on one page, with general admission tickets, the most popular (and profitable) action at the top. Member guest tickets became a list item with a direction to log in, rather than the first decision all users make when buying a ticket. Free ticket types were moved to the bottom—these users are often very high-intent in finding the options they’re eligible for.</p>
<p><img src="/img/moma-ticketing/ticketing-fork.png" alt="Choosing the right type of ticket"></p>
<p class="caption">The old fork (left) had a confusing hierarchy of ticket options. For the new flow, I chose to lay out the options in a linear, immediately actionable way.</p>
<p>Visitors with disabilities were eligible to receive a free ticket for a care partner, but they could only get these in person. We added the ability to reserve care partner tickets online, removing a hassle for these visitors during their lobby experience.</p>

<h3>Choosing intuitive language</h3>
<p>The language we used throughout the ticketing flow felt unintuitive—influenced by timed ticket slots and all its policies, a third party checkout solution, and the legacy of the ticketing flow as a place to communicate visitor policy. All of this led to a lack of visitor confidence in checking out—users often gave up online and planned to buy a ticket in person.</p>
<p>We tested the new language in the whole flow, including primary CTAs and progress bars, to ensure it felt intuitive to our users.</p>
<p><img src="/img/moma-ticketing/ticketing-language.png" alt="Progress bar and order summary"></p>
<p>Our site’s main CTA of “Reserve timed tickets” was a bit of a mouthful. I took the opportunity to A/B test language variations for this CTA, and a simple “Tickets” won out, with 88% more ticket purchases than the original.</p>

<h3>Helping visitors get excited and prepared for their visit</h3>
<p>We added some of the policy that we removed from earlier in the flow to the confirmation page, where we had more space to illustrate and explain what visitors could expect. Most visitors often only research logistics (like hours and bag policy) before their visit, and we wanted to easily provide this information, but also point them to pages on the website that would prepare them for what to see.</p>
