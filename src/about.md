<p class="divider-word">A bit more about me—</p>

### Prior to life as a product designer, I created brand activations with [Imprint Projects](https://imprintprojects.com/), swam with [+POOL](https://pluspool.com/), and launched streaming apps with [ABC](https://abc.com/).

### I’ve spoken at [Figma Config 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlrbBo9xYYU), MCN 2024, and Rutgers' Design Lecture Series; as well as classes at Parsons, Rutgers, and VCU.

### I received a BFA in Graphic Design from VCU, where I spent my formative design-years defining public space with [middle Of brOad studio](https://www.instagram.com/middleofbroadstudio/?hl=en).
