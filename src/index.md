### I’m a digital product designer based in NYC.

### I love to bring order to information, design outside of a vacuum, and create accessible experiences for all.

### Previously, I worked at [Big Human](https://www.bighuman.com/), a product studio with clients ranging from start-ups to nonprofits. I was involved with every part of the product process—starting with branding, and following through to high fidelity designs.
