### I’m a digital product designer based in NYC.

### I love to bring order to information, design outside of a vacuum, and create accessible experiences for all.


<p class="divider-word">Currently,</p>

### I'm a Senior Product Designer at [The Museum of Modern Art](https://www.moma.org), where I help our visitors explore the depth of MoMA’s exhibitions and collection.

In collaboration with an amazing team, I have designed the [online ticketing checkout](https://visit.moma.org/select), [moma.org's global navigation](https://www.moma.org), [the digital visitor guide](https://www.moma.org/visit/guide), [single sign on](https://login.moma.org/login?state=hKFo2SAwS0VHTk4xdHlMZ2dnamZ1NUJyME1xcUZoVFlqYzlmTqFupWxvZ2luo3RpZNkgUFZaR094Y3pZcFFIWEJGbFhqdlRfdG9NTTJKSm9OYjCjY2lk2SA4N3djTVc0MWFxcmIwV2Q2dDBESThrZ2F1N3VXUnh4TQ&client=87wcMW41aqrb0Wd6t0DI8kgau7uWRxxM&protocol=oauth2&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.moma.org%2Fauth%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=openid%20profile%20email&screen_hint=membership), [video channels](https://www.moma.org/calendar/channels/1), and more.

I’ve spoken at [Figma Config 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlrbBo9xYYU), [MCN 2024](https://mcn2024.sched.com/event/1gdB1/momas-visitor-guide-building-a-digital-product-to-assist-in-discovery-wayfinding-and-interpretation), and Rutgers' Design Lecture Series about my work at MoMA.

<p class="divider-word">Previously,</p>

### I was a designer at [Big Human](https://www.bighuman.com/), a full-service product studio. I was involved with every step of the product process, from branding to high fidelity design.

While there, I designed a dating app, a pattern library for a bank, a website for an estate planning startup, and a web app that connects New Yorkers experiencing homelessness with their caseworkers. [Subdial](https://subdial.app/), a community resource app that I designed and branded, was named one of Time Magazine’s Best Inventions of 2021.


<p class="divider-word">A bit about me—</p>

### Prior to life as a product designer, I designed primarily for physical spaces and nonprofits.

I created brand activations with [Imprint Projects](https://imprintprojects.com/), swam with [+POOL](https://pluspool.com/), and worked with community groups to define public space with [middle Of brOad studio](https://www.instagram.com/middleofbroadstudio/?hl=en). I received a BFA in graphic design from VCU.

I like to make sweaters and [quilts](https://www.are.na/stephanie-schapowal/quilts-8welg1sywlw) and collect [trucks](https://www.instagram.com/regulartruckrally/). I designed and built this website myself.
