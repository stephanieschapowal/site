### I’m a digital product designer based in NYC.

### I love to bring order to information, design outside of a vacuum, and create accessible experiences for all.


<p class="divider-word">Currently,</p>

### I'm a Senior Product Designer at [The Museum of Modern Art](https://www.moma.org), where I design new features to help our visitors explore the depth of MoMA’s offerings.

<p class="divider-word">Previously,</p>

### Previously, I worked at [Big Human](https://www.bighuman.com/), a product studio with clients ranging from start-ups to nonprofits. I was involved with every part of the product process—starting with branding, and following through to high fidelity designs.

### Prior to life as a product designer, I created brand activations with [Imprint Projects](https://imprintprojects.com/), swam with [+POOL](https://pluspool.com/), and launched streaming apps with [ABC](https://abc.com/).
