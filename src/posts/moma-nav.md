**My role**
<p>
I collaborated with another product designer to perform user research, and led visual design and visual QA.
</p>

**Team**
- One product manager (Debora Domass)
- Two designers (Madhav Tankha and me)
- One full stack developer (Kengo Ikeda-Iyeki) 

<p>
Earlier this year, we undertook a redesign of moma.org’s global navigation. Through ongoing user research for other projects, we noticed that our navigation was often a stumbling block— the nomenclature we used didn’t align with our users’ mental models. We also saw opportunities to increase revenue from ticket sales, and speed up the path to popular pages.

<p>
I led design on this project from start to finish. I did extensive research into our current navigation to identify problem areas, and tested each proposed architecture. I created the high fidelity designs, animated prototypes to model the interactions, and monitored analytics post-launch.
