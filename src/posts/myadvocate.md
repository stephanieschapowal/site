### Estate planning has a reputation of being paperwork-heavy, emotionally-fraught, and only for the rich.

MyAdvocate’s goal is to make the process of creating a will or trust accessible to all. They challenged us to create a brand that embodies warmth and encouragement, and apply that brand to a marketing site. Their founder had created a library of content to educate consumers on the estate-planning process, and so it was important to leverage this as an SEO-optimized marketing tool.

### Injecting warmth and trust into an emotionally-fraught process

MyAdvocate had a few elements of their existing brand they wanted to preserve—such as organic shapes and the color green—but for the most part we started fresh. We created moodboards to compose a palette that was warm and refined, and leaned into a few points of inspiration to create the logo: historic legal typefaces, the legacy of trees, and the language of documents.

Their team was slated to apply our branding to MyAdvocate’s product, so we worked closely with their designer to hand off a detailed Figma style guide and make sure they had everything that they needed. Leah created all of the spot illustrations for the site.

A common pattern is for users to search for artworks and artists using our global site search. Previously, on view artworks were not prioritized in listings, and gallery locations were not linked to the map.

On artist pages, we pushed artworks that were on view to the top of the list, and on artworks pages, we linked out to the gallery where the artwork was located. This made it much easier for visitors to use our site to find specific artworks and artist they wanted to see.

One of our major constraints is that we’re not able to implement geolocation, due to MoMA’s thick walls. While we explore other ways to implement this, we’ve compensated by adding more labels and description to the map itself.

### Visitors are engaging far more with the new map than with the old. 

The average DVG user session duration increased from 12 to 28 seconds (2.3x). Our lobby staff has reported that the map integration with the rest of the site has empowered users to find artworks themselves, rather than asking staff.

Visitors are also engaging more with the rest of moma.org. We also saw traffic increase to our Artwork, Exhibition, and Collection gallery pages. 

Our team continues to work on the visitor guide, and we'd love to explore geolocation, audio integration, and dynamic map labels next.
