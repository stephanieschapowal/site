### Estate planning has a reputation of being paperwork-heavy, emotionally-fraught, and only for the rich.

MyAdvocate’s goal is to make the process of creating a will or trust accessible to all. They challenged us to create a brand that embodies warmth and encouragement, and apply that brand to a marketing site. Their founder had created a library of content to educate consumers on the estate-planning process, and so it was important to leverage this as an SEO-optimized marketing tool.

### Injecting warmth and trust into an emotionally-fraught process

MyAdvocate had a few elements of their existing brand they wanted to preserve—such as organic shapes and the color green—but for the most part we started fresh. We created moodboards to compose a palette that was warm and refined, and leaned into a few points of inspiration to create the logo: historic legal typefaces, the legacy of trees, and the language of documents.

Their team was slated to apply our branding to MyAdvocate’s product, so we worked closely with their designer to hand off a detailed Figma style guide and make sure they had everything that they needed. Leah created all of the spot illustrations for the site.
