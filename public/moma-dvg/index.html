	<h2>Digital Visitor Guide</h2>

		A map that harnesses MoMA’s collection to improve wayfinding for visitors

<h3>Visitors are overwhelmed by MoMA’s scale, and aren’t sure where to start.</h3>
<p>Upon reopening in 2020, MoMA’s digital product team released an MVP digital visitor guide (or DVG), meant to replace onsite resources like paper maps, rentable audio devices, and volunteer guides. Over one million visitors use the DVG each year, and wayfinding is reported as our visitors’ biggest challenge.</p>
<p>The original DVG map was a link to a PDF. Unsurprisingly, our users found this difficult to navigate on their phones. The graphic design team also found it tedious to update, and visitor engagement still had to field hundreds of questions a day. We had the information users were looking for, like artwork locations and whether an exhibition is on view, but it wasn’t intuitive to find.</p>

<h4>Our goals:</h4>
<p>Harness MoMA’s existing data and CMS capabilities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help visitors decide where to start and find what to see</li>
<li>Reduce workload for our graphic design and visitor engagement teams</li>
</ul>
<h4>Completion</h4>
<p>July 2024</p>
<h4>My role</h4>
<p>I collaborated with another product designer to perform user research, and led visual design and visual QA.</p>
<h4>Team</h4>
<ul>
<li>Madhav Tankha (Assistant Director of UX)</li>
<li>Terrance Rose (Full stack developer)</li>
<li>Debora Domass (Product manager)</li>
<li>Tharani Prabu (Research fellow)</li>
</ul>

<h3>MoMA’s visitors typically fall into two groups—those visiting for the first time, and enthusiasts returning</h3>
<p>First-timers are typically tourists who want to see the whole museum, and consider MoMA to be a landmark. Repeat visitors are usually New Yorkers or members and are often drawn to MoMA to see a specific exhibition or artwork.</p>
<p>We wanted our work to address two main visitor challenges:
helping first-timers decide where to start or what to see, and helping repeat visitors find specific artworks and exhibitions.</p>
<p>An image-forward directory with a more modern map would be essential in serving both of these groups.</p>

<h3>Packaging our data into one tool for our onsite users</h3>
<p>moma.org runs on our internal CMS and the collection database TMS, meaning internal teams only need to update one entry in order to populate an exhibition page, homepage, and onsite screens. Why couldn’t the visitor guide also run on this data? This ensures that on view data for exhibitions and artworks, as well as their locations, exhibition run dates, locations are always up to date.</p>
<p>Originally, our visitor guide also had a section where you could explore all exhibitions and galleries on view. We learned while testing our prototypes that this wasn’t compelling to visitors. Instead, when asked to decide what to see, they went to the map. In the context of being onsite at the museum, visitors wanted to know both what was on view, but also how to get there. This led us to beef up the “On this floor” section below the map and deprioritize a separate “Current Exhibitions” page.</p>
<p>We also learned that visitors want to explore both the exhibitions listings as well as the map itself in order to discover what to see. This encouraged us to invest in making our map clickable, and for future features of exhibition labels on the map.</p>

<div class="body-content">
<p>A common pattern is for users to search for artworks and artists using our global site search. Previously, on view artworks were not prioritized in listings, and gallery locations were not linked to the map.</p>
<p>On artist pages, we pushed artworks that were on view to the top of the list, and on artworks pages, we linked out to the gallery where the artwork was located. This made it much easier for visitors to use our site to find specific artworks and artist they wanted to see.</p>

<div class="body-content">
<p>One of our major constraints is that we’re not able to implement geolocation, due to MoMA’s thick walls. While we explore other ways to implement this, we’ve compensated by adding more labels and description to the map itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="body-content">
<h3>Visitors are engaging far more with the new map than with the old.</h3>
<p>The average DVG user session duration increased from 12 to 28 seconds (2.3x). Our lobby staff has reported that the map integration with the rest of the site has empowered users to find artworks themselves, rather than asking staff.</p>
<p>Visitors are also engaging more with the rest of moma.org. We also saw traffic increase to our Artwork, Exhibition, and Collection gallery pages.</p>
<p>Our team continues to work on the visitor guide, and we'd love to explore geolocation, audio integration, and dynamic map labels next.</p>
