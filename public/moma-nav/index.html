	<h2>moma.org Navigation</h2>

	<p class="project-description">
		A global navigation that balances accessibility and accuracy
	</p>

	<main class="post">

<div class="body-content">
<p>The global navigation on moma.org is a user's first point of targeted exploraiton on our website. Through ongoing user research for other projects, we noticed that our navigation was often a stumbling block— the nomenclature we used to speak about ourselves didn’t align with our users’ mental models. We also saw opportunities to increase revenue from ticket sales, and speed up the path to popular pages.</p>
<p><img src="xxxxx" alt="MoMA's navigation, before and after our redesign"></p>
<p><strong>My role</strong></p>
<p>I led design on this project from start to finish. I did extensive research into our current navigation to identify problem areas, and tested each proposed architecture. I created the high fidelity designs, animated prototypes to model the interactions, and monitored analytics post-launch.</p>
<p><strong>Team</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Madhav Tankha (Assistant Director of UX)</li>
<li>Kengo Ikeda-Iyeki (Full stack developer)</li>
<li>Debora Domass (Product manager)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Streamline the journey for a prospective visitor, including buying a ticket online</li>
<li>Find terminology for our programs that's accessible to our visitors, yet still institutionally accurate</li>
<li>Modernize unconventional UX patterns</li>
</ul>
<p>These updates are live on moma.org.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Our users' challenges fell into two major categories: language and organization.</p>
<h2>Tackling MoMA's complicated relationship to language</h2>
<p>MoMA’s programming spans such a wide variety, that we often choose nomenclature that is general enough to contain it all. For example, “What’s on” can accurately contain exhibitions, film series, performances, concerts, workshops and more, but users can't necessarily infer this multitude of offerings. Additionally, colloquial language doesn't always translate cleanly for those using in-browser translators.</p>
<p>To dig more into how our choice of language was impacting user flow, we performed tree-testing and card-sorting exercises, and learned that:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Plan your visit” had different interpretations to different users. Many believed that this would contain information about hours and ticket pricing as well as information about artwork on view, when in reality this information was under “What’s on.”</li>
<li>“Visitor guide,” which contains our map and audio guides, also suggested information about amenities like the coat check, or a guide to interpreting modern art.</li>
<li>“Research and learning” also spoke to a much wider audience than its content actually served. This section is for small audience of researchers and academics, but many users expected to find general collection content there.</li>
<li>Some users don't know what a museum &quot;Collection&quot; is, or a page titled &quot;The Collection&quot; suggests a general information page about MoMA's total collection of artworks, and not an index of 100k+ artworks to explore.</li>
<li>Our main ticketing CTA, &quot;Reserve timed tickets,&quot; led users to immediately ask questions about our ticketing policy—are timed tickets required? What happens if I can't commit to a time slot?</li>
</ul>
<p>I incorporated these learnings into two new proposed nav structures, and tested them with visitors to our website. One closely mirrored our existing navigation, but with minor tweaks. The second was a radical re-organization around our two main audience segments: visit planners, and online-only researchers.</p>
<p>Neither was a clear winner, and I decided to merge elements from both into a third direction.</p>
<h4>Clarifying our ticketing language</h4>
<p>Since this redesign could have a major impact on the Museum’s online ticket sales, I ran several tests to feel confident that we would see an improvement from our baseline.</p>
<p>The first was to test alternate language for “Reserve timed tickets.” All of our variants performed better than the original, but the simple “Tickets” won out, while feeling linguistically symmetrical with our “Membership” dropdown.</p>
<p>xxxxI also tested a more prominent design for the ticketing CTA. Our first results were amazing—a 9% increase in ticket sales, and a 40% increase in views to the page, and a possibility for up to 22% more clickthroughs to the Store.</p>
